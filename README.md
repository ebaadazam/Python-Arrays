## Python-Arrays
Array is a container which can hold fixed number of items and these items must be of same data type. They are stored in contiguous memory location so that accessing any element randomly happends in constant time.
In this repository, I have performed various array operations. Some of the operations that are performed in arrays are as follows:

Traverse() - It involves accessing all the elements one by one until it reaches the end

Insertion() - It involves adding the element at the given index position. In this repository, I have provided the code for inserting an element at the beginning, middle and end.

Deletion() - It involves deleting the element from the given index position. In this repository, I have provided the code for deleting an element from the beginning, end and from the specific position.

Search() - It involves searching the particular element using the given index position or by the value.
